# Links are things that are added to the existing
# pages. They point to routes, which are associated
# with a controller to output content and a URL.

#
# Add link under 'Manage -> Configuration -> Content Authoring'
# To go to our view config route.
#
# See the routes named in core/modules/system/system.links.menu.yml
# for a list of potential parents to put our link under.
