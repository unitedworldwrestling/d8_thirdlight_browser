#
# Routes define mappings between some state name
# (eg thirdlight_browser.config), a URL that is
# associated with that state, and some reference to
# code to fire off to generate our view.
#
# state names are used elsewhere to reference the routes,
# eg when defining links to them in the drupal menu structure.
#
# the _controller/_form syntax denotes what will be handling the
# route (some method in a controller, or a form controller and its
# methods). the code lives under:
#
# thirdlight_browser/src/{Form|Controller}/{name}.php[::methodToCall()]
#

#
# This is the entry point to our configuration page.
# It displays the configuration and provides links
# to edit it.
#
thirdlight_browser.config:
  path: '/admin/config/content/thirdlight_browser'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\thirdlight_browser\Controller\Config::configPage'
    _title: 'Third Light Browser'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'administer thirdlight_browser'

#
# This route takes us to a Form controller
# which handles editing the global configuration
#
thirdlight_browser.config.globalsettings:
  path: '/admin/config/content/thirdlight_browser/global_settings'
  defaults:
    _form:  '\Drupal\thirdlight_browser\Form\GlobalConfig'

  requirements:
    _permission: 'administer thirdlight_browser'

#
# These routes are for working with output formats.
#
# Our Edit and Add routes just exist so we can pass a param in to
# the form controller so that it knows what to do. They are both
# identical to eachother other than the title.
#
# Our delete route just performs the delete and redirects back to
# the main page, so it will hardly be visible.
